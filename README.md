# WilsonMedMNIST
WilsonMedMNIST is a project that explores the [MedMNIST datasets](https://medmnist.com/v1) using  the Java Encog framework, and the artificial neural network.

# Description 
The goal of this project is to explore the MedMNIST datasets and create at least three models with a success rate similar to those found in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14925.pdf). The three MedMNIST datasets we plan on using are PneumoniaMNIST, RetinaMNIST, and BreastMNIST.
